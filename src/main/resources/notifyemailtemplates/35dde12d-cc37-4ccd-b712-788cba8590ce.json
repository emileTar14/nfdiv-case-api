They have to apply before the ((isDivorce??marriage))((isDissolution??civil partnership)) can be legally ended because this is a joint application. \r\n\r\n#What you can do \r\n The quickest way to ((isDivorce??finalise the divorce))((isDissolution??end the civil partnership)) is for the other applicant((partner is represented??'s solicitor)) to confirm the joint application for a final order. They have been emailed a reminder to do this. \r\n\r\nIf you do not think they will confirm the application then you can apply for a final order as a sole applicant, on behalf of your client.  \r\n\r\nFirst you will need to confirm that you are intending to make the application. The court will then serve notice on the other applicant. If they do not object or ask the court to delay the issuing of the final order then you will be able to make a sole application for a final order 14 days later.  \r\n\r\nYou can confirm your client's intention to apply for a final order as a sole applicant in your online account.
