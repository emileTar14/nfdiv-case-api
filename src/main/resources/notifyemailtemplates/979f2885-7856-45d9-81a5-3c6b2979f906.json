You do this by signing into your account and selecting the 'switch to sole CO' event from the menu. \r\n\r\n((signin url)) \r\n\r\nDivorce and Dissolution\r\nHM Courts & Tribunals Service\r\ndivorcecase@justice.gov.uk\r\n0300 303 0642 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm)\r\n\r\nYour feedback helps improve this service for others: https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/Divorce_Feedback/?pageurl=/email","subject":"Update on this ((isDivorce??divorce application))((isDissolution??application to end your civil partnership))","personalisation":{"signin url":{"required":true},"solicitor name":{"required":true},"solicitor reference":{"required":true},"reference number":{"required":true},"applicant name":{"required":true},"isDissolution":{"required":true},"isDivorce":{"required":true},"issueDate":{"required":true},"respondent name":{"required":true}},"letterContactBlock":null}
